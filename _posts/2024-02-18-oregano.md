## 2- common use :
I've met an old woman in Sebt Jahjouh, a small region near El Hajeb, Morocco. I asked her about the common uses of oregano in this region, and I tried to organize her answers in this section .

Oregano is commonly used for :

**Hypertension (high blood pressure ):**

If you are feeling chest pain, nausea, or blurred vision, it might be due to hypertension,(Sometimes it might be another condition) , so you might  need to use some oregano with hot water .

**Hair loss :**

if you are experiencing hair loss , you might like to apply oregano on your hair before taking a shower .

I looked into these two uses, and  I found that oregano contains carvacrol. Research has shown that it reduces blood pressure. Also, oregano contains vitamin C, which reduces hair loss, because vitamin C is essential for collagen production.

## 3-classification : 
I'm sharing information about oregano to help you recognize other plants that are similar. Some of them might be toxic. 
Oregano, scientifically known as Origanum vulgare, is a fragrant herb that belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae). It's famous for its tasty dried leaves and flowering tops. 
The Lamiales family, to which oregano belongs, has certain key features, and a picture below illustrates these characteristics.![]({{ 'lamiales.jpg' | relative_url }})


## 4- medical definition :
Oregano (Origanum vulgare) is an herb used to flavor foods. It is considered safe in common food amounts, but has little evidence of health benefits. Oregano has olive-green leaves and purple flowers. It is closely related to other herbs, including mint, thyme, marjoram, and basil.

## 5-Medical uses : 
This section  will diverge from the previous two articles. In this new article, our focus will shift to the  drugs that have been synthesized from oregano.
