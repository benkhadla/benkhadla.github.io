I took this picture in Sebt Jahjouh, located in the El Hajeb province. This region is characterized by a moderate climate with distinct seasons, experiencing mild winters and warm summers. The soil in Sebt Jahjouh is predominantly fertile, allowing for the successful cultivation of various crops, including the notable anise plant. The combination of the temperate climate and fertile soil contributes to the agricultural richness of this area.
