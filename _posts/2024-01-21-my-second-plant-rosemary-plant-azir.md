Hello and welcome to my blog! My second post will focus on a well-known plant in Morocco celebrated for its numerous benefits: the rosemary plant, also known as Azir. Following a conversation with an elderly woman residing in Sebt Jahjouh and conducting some research, I've compiled the information I gathered, which I will now organize in my article.

    I took this picture in Sebt Jahjouh, located in the El Hajeb province. This region is characterized by a moderate climate with distinct seasons, experiencing mild winters and warm summers. The soil in Sebt Jahjouh is predominantly fertile, allowing for the successful cultivation of various crops, including therosemary plant. The combination of the temperate climate and fertile soil contributes to the agricultural richness of this area.

 I looked into it and found that rosmarinic acid is the key element in rosemary that helps with pain. For those who might not know, rosmarinic acid has anti-inflammatory properties, which means it helps reduce pain and swelling.
 And for  promoting hair health, rosemary contains compounds like 1,8-cineole and camphor. These elements are commonly utilized in traditional remedies to encourage hair growth and minimize hair loss.

Rosemary is classified in the order Lamiales. To put it simply, Lamiales is a group or category in the plant kingdom that includes various flowering plants.

**camphor** :Camphor is a white crystalline substance with a distinctive odor, derived from the wood of the camphor tree or synthesized chemically.
