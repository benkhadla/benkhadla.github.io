My second post will focus on a well-known plant in Morocco celebrated for its numerous benefits: the rosemary plant, also known as Azir. Following a conversation with an elderly woman residing in Sebt Jahjouh and conducting some research, I‚Äôve compiled the information I gathered, which I will now organize in my article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-  Plant Image&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;2- Common Use&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;3- Classification&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;4- Medical Definition&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;5-  Medical Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so let‚Äôs start this new journey :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1--plant-image&quot;&gt;1- Plant Image:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/azir.webp&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this picture in Sebt Jahjouh, located in the El Hajeb province. This region is characterized by a moderate climate with distinct seasons, experiencing mild winters and warm summers. The soil in Sebt Jahjouh is predominantly fertile, allowing for the successful cultivation of various crops, including  rosemary  plant. The combination of the temperate climate and fertile soil contributes to the agricultural richness of this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked into it and found that rosmarinic acid is the key element in rosemary that helps with pain. For those who might not know, rosmarinic acid has anti-inflammatory properties, which means it helps reduce pain and swelling.
 And for  promoting hair health, rosemary contains compounds like 1,8-cineole and camphor. These elements are commonly utilized in traditional remedies to encourage hair growth and minimize hair loss

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-classification-&quot;&gt;3-classification :&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosemary is classified in the order Lamiales. To put it simply, Lamiales is a group or category in the plant kingdom that includes various flowering plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;4--medical-definition-&quot;&gt;4- medical definition :&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) is an evergreen bushy shrub which grows along the Mediterranean Sea, and sub-Himalayan areas . 
the main chemical compound found in rosemary are : 
&lt;strong&gt;1,8-cineole&lt;/strong&gt;: known for its mucolytic ( Mucolytics are medications that break up mucus so you can clear it out of your lungs more easily) and spasmolytic (drug used to relieve or prevent spasms) action on the respiratory tract, with proven clinical efficacy
&lt;strong&gt;camphor&lt;/strong&gt; :Camphor is a white crystalline substance with a distinctive odor, derived from the wood of the camphor tree or synthesized chemically. It is used for its pain-relieving, anti-inflammatory, and antispasmodic properties in various medical applications, including topical creams, respiratory relief products, and as an ingredient in some skin care formulations.
&lt;strong&gt;Œ±-pinene&lt;/strong&gt;: It is known for its pleasant aroma and is being studied for potential medical benefits, including anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator properties.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, we will start our journey by learn about anise, a special plant in Sebt Jahjouh, where I grew up. In our town, we‚Äôre big producers of anise in Morocco. Let‚Äôs explore anise together by looking at some simple things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1- Plant Image:&lt;/strong&gt;
I‚Äôll share a picture and provide insights into where it was taken, which will give us an idea about the  plant‚Äôs natural habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2-Common Use:&lt;/strong&gt;
 We‚Äôll explore its common uses and unravel the cultural significance attached to this herb in our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3- Classification:&lt;/strong&gt;
we will delve into the scientific side as we explore how anise is classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4- Medical Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;
 we will try to understand anise from a medical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5- Medical Use:&lt;/strong&gt;
We‚Äôll delve into medications that incorporate the use of anise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ,let‚Äôs begin our journey
 ## 1- plant image&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this picture in Sebt Jahjouh, located in the El Hajeb province. This region is characterized by a moderate climate with distinct seasons, experiencing mild winters and warm summers. The soil in Sebt Jahjouh is predominantly fertile, allowing for the successful cultivation of various crops, including the notable anise plant. The combination of the temperate climate and fertile soil contributes to the agricultural richness of this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here is my father‚Äôs description of the plant:
&lt;img src=&quot;/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-11-06%20at%2014.59.26_780bbb1a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;translated (from moroccan language to english ):
 ‚ÄùThe flowering season begins in March and April, and we plant between 14 kg and 18 kg per hectare, it is usually used to treat  constipation and intestinal gas ,Additionally, our grandparents traditionally used it as an appetite stimulant for newborns and children.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## 2- Common Use
**constipation
intestinal gas
appetite stimulation **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we can get those benefits by consuming anise tea after meals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3--classification&quot;&gt;3- Classification:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family.
This image showcases the primary characteristics and form of the Apiaceae family.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4--medical-use-and--definition&quot;&gt;4- Medical use and  Definition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anise (Pimpinella anisum) is one of the oldest known spice plants. It grows in the Mediterranean, Spain, West Asia, Mexico, Egypt, and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anise contains chemicals that might have estrogen-like effects .  and it also purported galactogogue(a food that boosts the  production of breast milk), and it  is included in some pharmaceutical mixtures promoted to increase milk supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed this journey because it provided me with a deeper understanding of many aspects of anise that I had heard about but didn‚Äôt fully comprehend before.&lt;/p&gt;
