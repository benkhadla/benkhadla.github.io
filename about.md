# intro

Hi, I'm Hanae Ben Khadla. I grew up on a farm in Sebt Jahjouh, a small town in Morocco.
I used to watch my dad, who is a farmer, taking care of plants, growing vegetables, and fruits.

I was always amazed by these incredible living things, they give us food, shade on a sunny day and warm fire on a cold night, they are also used in healthcare.

I decided to be a pharmacist, to really understand the science behind the beauty of plants.

And now, I chose to go on this journey to protect and explore more Morocco's traditional medicine, which mostly comes from plants.

# The project
